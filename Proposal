Project: A chat room
Members: Dominic Amaral (Not yet in a group)

Problem: Some friends want to be able to communicate with each other on their computers without having to download some third party\n
software in order to do it. They want to be able to chat to each other through private and group conversations. Being able to voice \n
chat would also be a plus, as well as being able to send pictures/videos to each other.

Solution: Develop a chat room program in python that allows users across multiple devices to communicate with each other. Will \n
provide ability for both private one on one conversations as well as group conversations. Also include the ability for a voice chat.\n
Multimedia support to be included. Other features (emojis, etcâ€¦) to be included if time permits. 

Responsibilities(as of now): Dominic (server, client, GUI)

Action Plan: 
	Give each major component of the program (server script, client script, GUI) an equal amount of time to develop while leaving \n
  time towards the end for any bug fixes and adjustments. Start with developing the server script, then the client script. \n
  Implement the GUI and integrate with the server and client scripts. If development takes less time than expected, then use \n
  this time to implement additional features to create a better user experience.

Timeline: 
Total Time: ~7 weeks
Server: ~2 weeks
Client: ~2 weeks
Gui: ~2 weeks
Bug fixes/Final adjustments: ~1 week
